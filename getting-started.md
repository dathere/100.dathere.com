# Getting started

This section includes introductory lessons including concepts found commonly in qsv and command-line usage. If you're new to qsv or want to follow the exercises in order, continue on to the first lesson.

:::{admonition} Reminder for each exercise
:class: important

If you're running exercises locally then make sure you change your directory (`cd`) into the relevant directory in the `lessons` folder for each exercise. For example for the first exercise you may run this command from the root folder:

```bash
cd lessons/0
```
